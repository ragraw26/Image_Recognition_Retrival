Section 5: Display Best Results 


# ML ALGORITHMS

We have use the following Machine Learning Algorithm to train and test our Model  namely (No Library used):

K – Means Clustering : 
k-means clustering aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster. This results in a partitioning of the data space into Voronoi cells.

K- Nearest Neighbors :
In pattern recognition, the k-nearest neighbors algorithm (k-NN) is a non-parametric method used for classification and regression. In both cases, the input consists of the k closest training examples in the feature space. The output depends on whether k-NN is used for classification or regression

Euclidean Distance :
Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the "ordinary" straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.
